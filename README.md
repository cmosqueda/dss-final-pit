# DSS PIT - COVID-19 Misinformation Classification

## Info

In this project, we are tasked to train different text classification models on a **COVID-19 Misinformation Dataset**. _This is for a final group project in our course Decision Support Systems. This is not made for deployment._

## Objectives

- To obtain and use existing raw datasets from reputable and credible resources.
- To clean and preprocess the obtained raw datasets.
- To train and test different text classification models (classical and deep learning) on the preprocessed dataset.
- To analyze and evaluate the performance of different models.

## Setup:

1. for efficient dependency management and maintainability, set up python venv inside the root project directory. enter `python -m venv venv` on the terminal.
2. activate venv by entering `venv/Scripts/activate` or `venv\Scripts\activate` on the terminal. shell should indicate a `(venv)`.
3. then, install the necessary libraries from requirements.txt by entering `pip install -r requirements.txt` on the terminal.
4. if new library has been installed, update the requirements.txt by entering `pip freeze > requirements.txt` on the terminal.
